# Mock Interviews
## Feature Tasks

1- Ask the candidate to write a function to validate whether or not a Linked list is palindrome

2- Help the candidate understand the definition of a Palindrome if he/she is unsure of it

3- Avoid utilizing any of the built-in methods available in your language.

4- This problem can be solved using different approaches:

Using a helper data structure (Array or Linked List) to keep track of the nodes.
This method takes O(n) and uses O(n) extra space.

Reversing the Linked List, and checking for equality of the reversed part.
