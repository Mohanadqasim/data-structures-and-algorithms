# Mock Interviews
## Feature Tasks

1- Ask the candidate to write a function to add up the sum of each row in a matrix of arbitrary size, and return an array with the appropriate values.

2- Avoid utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language.

3- Don’t let the candidate get scared by the term “matrix”… It’s just an array of arrays.

4- The matrix will always be full of integers.

5- Negative values are possible.

6- All nulls will be counted as zeros.
